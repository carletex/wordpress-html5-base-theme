# Wordpress html5 base theme

Minimal html5 theme for Wordpress. I use this theme on my WP projects:

## Use

You can create a [child-theme](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes), or you can rather edit the theme directly with the following steps.


1. Download/Clone this repository
2. Create a folder with you theme name and move the files inside
3. In functions.php, search and replace 'wordpresstheme' to your theme name
4. In style.css, change the metadata as you need
5. Ready to develop!

## Include

**css/Normalize.css**: Makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing. [Read more](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).

***js/vendor/html5shiv.min.js**: Source code adds new HTML5 elements (which is simple code), but also supports printing HTML5 elements and includes the default styles for HTML5 elements, like block on article and section. [Read more](https://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/).
